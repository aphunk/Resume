:wave: **Hello!**
As a Product Designer in the technology field I became passionate about technology that works to improve the lives of its users. Close collaboration with the Engineering team exposed me to a different side of the product development process that I was enthralled by and simultaneously troubled by: the disparity between the makers of the product and the users of the product. I'm seeking to grow as a developer with a team that shares my belief that a diverse and inclusive team of collaborators is what creates the most innovative and successful technology.
